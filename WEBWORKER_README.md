# Web Worker Implementation for POW Mining

## Problem
The `createPowGiftWrappedNote` function performs computationally intensive Proof of Work (POW) mining that can block the UI thread for several seconds or longer, especially with higher difficulty levels.

## Solution
We've implemented a Web Worker solution that moves the POW computation to a separate thread, allowing the UI to remain responsive during mining.

## Implementation

### 1. Web Worker (`public/pow-worker.js`)
- Runs POW computation in a separate thread
- Handles message passing with the main thread
- Includes safety timeouts and periodic yielding
- Currently uses simulated POW for demonstration

### 2. Custom Hook (`app/hooks/usePowWorker.ts`)
- Manages Web Worker lifecycle
- Handles message serialization/deserialization
- Provides promise-based API for POW computation
- Includes error handling and request management

### 3. UI Integration (`app/p/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Smart switching between Web Worker and main thread based on difficulty
- Progress indicators showing which method is being used
- Fallback mechanism if Web Worker fails
- Non-blocking UI during mining process

## Usage

```typescript
const { createPowNote } = usePowWorker();

// This will run in a Web Worker (non-blocking)
const event = await createPowNote({
  senderPrivkey,
  recipient,
  message,
  difficulty
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Non-blocking UI**: Users can interact with the interface while POW mining occurs
2. **Better UX**: Visual feedback shows mining progress without freezing
3. **Responsive**: UI remains responsive during computation
4. **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if Web Worker fails
5. **Smart switching**: Uses main thread for low difficulty (faster), Web Worker for high difficulty

## Configuration

- **Difficulty threshold**: Web Worker is used for difficulty â‰¥ 4
- **Timeout**: 60-second safety timeout for mining operations
- **Fallback**: Main thread with 30-second timeout if Web Worker fails

## Production Considerations

For production use, you should:
1. Properly bundle nostr-tools dependencies for the Web Worker environment
2. Implement actual POW mining logic instead of the simulation
3. Add more sophisticated error handling
4. Consider using SharedArrayBuffer for progress updates
5. Implement cancellation mechanism for long-running operations

## Browser Compatibility

Web Workers are supported in all modern browsers. The implementation includes:
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Error boundaries for worker failures
- Graceful fallback for unsupported environments
